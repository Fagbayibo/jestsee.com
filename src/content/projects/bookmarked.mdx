## Project Overview

Bookmarked is a personal bookmarking tool which inspired by <Tooltip content='Save to notion is a bookmarking tool which utilize Twitter bot to save tweet to Notion' client:only='react'>[Save to Notion](https://x.com/savetonotion)</Tooltip>. It uses a Telegram bot as the client, enabling users to forward tweet URLs to easily save tweets or threads. The backend processes these requests by performing web scraping to extract content from tweets or threads on X (formerly Twitter).

## Project Goals and Motivation

X (formerly known as Twitter) is a treasure trove of tech insights and tips, and I frequently found myself gathering valuable information there. Initially, I used the "like" button to save these tweets, but retrieving specific information later proved to be tedious and inefficient.

I began searching for tools to help me save, organize, and easily access this information, which led me to [Save to Notion](https://x.com/savetonotion). While it served the purpose, as a free-plan user, I encountered several limitations. The most inconvenient aspect was having to publicly mention the [Save to Notion](https://x.com/savetonotion) Twitter bot as a reply to the tweet or thread I wanted to save.

My goal was to create a free bookmarking tool that could save tweets to Notion like [Save to Notion](https://x.com/savetonotion), but tailored to my preferences. To avoid the costs associated with using Twitterâ€™s ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ API (required for creating a Twitter bot), I decided to use a Telegram bot instead. This approach allowed me to forward tweet links directly to the bot, especially on mobile devices, without the need for public mentions or expensive API costs.

## Tech Stacks Used

### Notion

Stores all bookmarked tweets. Each tweet or thread is saved as an individual page in a Notion database with the following properties: Author, Tags, Tweet Date, Tweet Link, and Type (Tweet/Thread).

### NestJS

Powers the back-end, built with TypeScript for enhanced type safety. This project was my introduction to NestJS, offering a great learning experience.

- **Puppeteer**: Utilized as a headless browser for web scraping.
- **BullMQ**: Handles queue management for the scraping process, seamlessly integrated with NestJS.
- **EventEmitter2**: Constructs SSE (Server-Sent Event) responses to send real-time updates to the client.

### Next.js

Builds the web app and handles authentication using NextAuth. It also manages user data and acts as a proxy to communicate with the NestJS backend.

### Telegram

Functions as the client for submitting bookmark requests and receiving responses about bookmark status. Built using Telegraf.js, it provides a convenient interface for mobile users to forward tweet links effortlessly.

## Features

### Save Tweets Privately

No need to mention a Twitter bot publiclyâ€”just easily forward the tweet or threadâ€™s URL to the Telegram bot.

### Never Lose Your Bookmarked Tweet Again

The image might get deleted if the author deletes their post, sets it to private, or deactivates their account, but not the text content. After successfully bookmarking a tweet, it will remain there forever unless you delete it manually.

### Reading Experience

Say goodbye to the "Show more" button. Once saved to Notion, you can read a long thread conveniently without having to press the "Show more" button to expand each tweet's full content.

### Easily Organize and Share Your Bookmarks Collection

Customize your own bookmarks viewer: group by tag, display as a collection, list, etc. Turn it into a public site that anyone can access. Share your bookmarked collection with friends, especially for sharing long threads with non-X users.
