## Project Overview

Bookmarked is a personal bookmarking tool inspired by <Tooltip content='A powerful bookmarking tool for saving tweets to Notion, built by [@Abdulhade_Ahmad](https://x.com/Abdulhade_Ahmad)' isMarkdownContent client:only='react'>[Save to Notion](https://x.com/savetonotion)</Tooltip>. It features a web interface and a Telegram bot as clients, enabling users to save tweets and threads simply by forwarding URLs. The backend retrieves content from Twitter using web scraping.

## Project Goals and Motivation

X (formerly known as Twitter) is a _treasure trove_ of tech insights and tips, and I often found myself collecting valuable information there. Initially, I used the `like` button to save these tweets, but retrieving specific information later became _tedious and inefficient_.

That's when I discovered Save to Notion, which was a game changer. It combined the best of both worlds—useful information and an organized second brain, making it easy to retrieve saved content.

While it served its purpose, as a _free user_, I encountered several limitations. The biggest inconvenience was the need to publicly mention the SaveToNotion Twitter bot in a reply to save a tweet or thread.

{/* TODO: insert image of publicly mention the bot */}

So, I built my own bookmarking tool to save tweets to Notion, tailored to my preferences. Using a Telegram bot as the client, it allows me to forward tweet links directly to the bot, especially on mobile devices, without the need for public mentions.

## Meet my NT Stack

This project utilizes several tech stacks, divided into three repositories:
backend, web application, and Telegram bot.

### <Notion />Notion

Stores all bookmarked tweets. Each tweet or thread is saved as an individual page in a Notion database with the following properties: Author, Tags, Tweet Date, Tweet Link, and Type (Tweet/Thread).

### <Nestjs />NestJS

Powers the back-end, built with TypeScript for enhanced type safety. This project was my introduction to NestJS, offering a great learning experience.

- **Puppeteer**: Utilized as a headless browser for web scraping.
- **BullMQ**: Handles queue management for the scraping process, seamlessly integrated with NestJS.
- **EventEmitter2**: Constructs SSE (Server-Sent Event) responses to send real-time updates to the client.

### <NextJs />Next.js

Builds the web app and handles authentication using NextAuth. It also manages user data and acts as a proxy to communicate with the NestJS backend.

### <TelegramFilled />Telegram

Functions as the client for submitting bookmark requests and receiving responses about bookmark status. Built using Telegraf.js, it provides a convenient interface for mobile users to forward tweet links effortlessly.

## Features

### Save Tweets Privately

No need to mention a Twitter bot publicly—just easily forward the tweet or thread’s URL to the Telegram bot.

### Never Lose Your Bookmarked Tweet Again

The image might get deleted if the author deletes their post, sets it to private, or deactivates their account, but not the text content. After successfully bookmarking a tweet, it will remain there forever unless you delete it manually.

### Reading Experience

Say goodbye to the "Show more" button. Once saved to Notion, you can read a long thread conveniently without having to press the "Show more" button to expand each tweet's full content.

### Easily Organize and Share Your Bookmarks Collection

Customize your own bookmarks viewer: group by tag, display as a collection, list, etc. Turn it into a public site that anyone can access. Share your bookmarked collection with friends, especially for sharing long threads with non-X users.
